Welcome! I'm a student at John Cabot University, majoring in International Affairs with a minor in Legal Studies. I have a solid background that spans many disciplines, between my role as Editor in Chief at The Matthew and my data analyst skills that include R programming, Python, text analysis, and visualization. On this website you can find my projects, showcasing my abilities in identifying and analyzing trends, data visualization, and proposing policy changes.
